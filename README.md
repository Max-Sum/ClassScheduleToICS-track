# ClassScheduleToICS

A Chrome extension to export your class schedule as an ICS file.
Theoretically, it should work on any system powered by the same software (Oracle Peoplesoft, I suspect),
but I currently limit the functionality to UW (University of Waterloo) Quest in the manifest file so the script doesn't run on all websites.

## Download
